# Changelog

## 2.1.0

Packaged as a **standalone macOS app** (like data-manager) for one-download
accessibility — no Python/uv/clone needed.

### Added
- **Desktop .app** — `packaging/build.sh` produces `dist/paper-review-<arch>.zip`
  (PyInstaller bundle: FastAPI backend + vendored engine + UI). Double-click opens
  a native **pywebview** window over the local server. First launch copies the
  skills into `~/.claude/skills` and installs the subagents.
- `paper-review app` runs the same window in dev.

### Changed
- Vendored scripts now run via a self-re-exec dispatcher (`_run-script`) instead
  of `python <file>`, so the pipeline works inside a frozen bundle. uvicorn is
  started from the app object (import strings don't resolve when frozen). PATH is
  augmented at launch so a Finder-launched app still finds `claude`.

### Notes
- **Review/chat still require the Claude Code CLI** installed and signed in — it
  can't be bundled. ingest, browsing, and publish work without it.
- The app is ad-hoc signed: first launch needs right-click → Open.

## 2.0.0

Expands the service from papers-only to **papers, engineering/release blogs, and
general web articles**, and adds a settings surface.

### Added
- **Web content** — ingest any URL (`paper-review init <url>` or paste a link in
  the gallery). Source kind is auto-detected (arXiv · PDF · web) and web content
  is classified `blog` vs `article`. Web ingest extracts a clean markdown body,
  section index, and inline figures (incl. SVG) via `fetch_web.py`.
- **Per-type review skills** — `blog-review`, `article-review` alongside
  `paper-review`, sharing one engine (`_paper_reader/references/review-engine.md`).
- **Reading-list save for web** — save a URL with metadata only, promote to a
  full ingest later (▶ Analyze).
- **Publish by type** — `paper-publish` reshapes the workbench using a
  content-type-aware template (paper / blog / article); web drafts inline their
  figures by section.
- **Settings panel** (⚙, top-right of the gallery) — switch themes, view/edit
  installed skills, manage card illustrations (upload / soft-delete to _trash).
- **Themes** — light/dark plus brand-referenced (Stripe, Figma, Tesla — see
  `~/Documents/design/themes/`) and original (Sunset, Sage) themes, applied
  across the gallery, detail, and source viewer.
- **Illustration grouping** — cards pick a thumbnail from the group mapped to
  their tags (vision / language / generative / systems / general), spreading
  usage so similar-tag papers look consistent without repeating.
- **Source viewer** — web detail pages render the original article (figures
  placed inline by section) in place of the PDF pane.
- **Tests** — a pytest smoke suite (routes, skills, transform, settings).

### Fixed / hardened
- Figure-export path-traversal guard; HTML-escaped page titles; UTF-8 for
  skill/groups file I/O.

### Notes
- The skills directory is the source of truth, symlinked into `~/.claude/skills`
  via `install-skills.sh`. Changing server routes requires restarting the
  menubar app (templates/CSS/JS hot-reload on refresh).

## 0.1.0
- Initial release: arXiv/PDF paper ingest, section-by-section review with
  Claude, Velog draft export, FastAPI gallery + macOS menubar.
